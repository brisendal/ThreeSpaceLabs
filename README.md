# ThreeSpaceLabs
A sample repo for use in my application to Three Space Labs

All three scripts have been created for use in Unity 3D

BallScript is from an experiment in VR, trying to simulate a game of catch with an NPC. (See also resume, project at the Colorado School of Public Health).

Gravity Plane come from a personal project working to experiment with multiple gravity sources, other than simple downwards forces.

MapGenerator is the most complex, generating a random 2D 'cave map' when run.
